## About Tests

I'm aware tests are an important part of every software development process. But since it was not demanded in the requirements, I skipped them.

Also I've only done testing with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) testing framework. And frameworks are stated as not allowed in the requirements.
